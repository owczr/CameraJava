# Camera Desktop Application
## About
This project is a desktop application made for microscopes at our university, written in Java with JavaFX. <br>
When running it uses an `example.jpg` file to imitate camera frame. <br>
Implementation of actual microscope frames handling are commented, because a custom C library that provided communication betweeen 
program and camera is missing. It was only available at our university. <br>
## Other info
This project was made for Java Programming course, during winter semester of 3rd year of Data Engineering and Analysis on AGH UST. <br>
It was made in collaboration with [Shamte Ndiaye](https://github.com/ShamteN).
